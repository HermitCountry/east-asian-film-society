          <h1>East Asian Film Society</h1>
          <p>The East Asian Film Society was founded in Honolulu, HI as a way of bringing difficult to find East Asian films on the campus of University of Hawai`i at Mānoa. The scope was soon expanded to provide screenings for the entire Honolulu community. Grants were awarded by the SEED, the Associated Students Union of UH, and the East Asian Council. Additionally the Center for Korean Studies at UH Mānoa hired us to run two semesters of film programs of South Korean films. </p>

          <a name="rights"></a><h2>Rights Management</h2>
          <p>Negotiating fees and permissions to screen foreign films can be difficult, confusing, and time consuming; especially in the case of obscure or lesser known films. With our experience bringing films to the US region from East Asia and through our working relationships with several governmental organizations including the <a href="">Korean Film Archive</a>, the Hong Kong Film Archive and the Chinese Taipei Film Archive we are able to ensure that all necessary permissions are granted and that filmmakers and stakeholders receive compensation for the film screenings, if applicable. </p>
          <p>We specialize in organizing screenings for non-profit and educational institutions and have worked closely with and sought advice from legal departments at major US institutions to ensure that our screenings do not violate any copyright laws. We ensure that the legal status of each film we screen is given in writing and additionally provide documentation of all payments to the rightsholders.</p>
          <p class="well">We strive to take the guess work out of the increasingly complicated and confusing task of arranging film screenings so you can focus on the films themselves!</p>
