          <h1>East Asian Film Society</h1>
          <p>The East Asian Film Society was founded in Honolulu, HI in the Fall of 2010 by graduate students at the University of Hawai`i at Mānoa as a way of offering free screenings of difficult to find films from East Asia. As the Society grew in popularity and size it began to coordinate with several Departments at UH Mānoa and eventually began organizing free film screenings for the general public in Honolulu.</p>

          <p>During the course of the organization we have been fortunate to receive funding form a variety of sources. This has included a <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/diversity/dei/">Diversity and Equity Initiative Award</a> from the UH Office of Student Equity Excellence and Diversity, funding from the <a href="http://asuh.hawaii.edu/">Associated Students of the University of Hawai`i</a> and funding from the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/korea/">Center for Korean Studies</a>, <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cjs/">Center for Japanese Studies</a>, and <a href="http://www.ccs-uhm.org/">Center for Chinese Studies</a> through the <a href="http://manoa.hawaii.edu/eastasia/">National Resource Center East Asia</a>. In addition to our regular film screenings we ran a year of film programing for the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/korea/">Center for Korean Studies</a> as part of their Fall and Spring Semester film programs. </p>

          <p class="well">In August of 2012 the East Asian Film Society expanded into the Seattle area and is currently looking for venues and partners to help bring free screenings of rare and difficult to find East Asian films to the Greater Seattle Area. Please contact us if you are interested in being involved as a member, sponsor, or event host.<br><br><a class="btn" href="contact.html">Contact Us &raquo;</a></p>

          <a name="rights"></a><h2>Rights Management</h2>
          <p>Negotiating fees and permissions to screen foreign films can be difficult, confusing, and time consuming; especially in the case of obscure or lesser known films. With our experience bringing films to the US region from East Asia and through our working relationships with several governmental organizations including the <a href="">Korean Film Archive</a>, the Hong Kong Film Archive and the Chinese Taipei Film Archive we are able to ensure that all necessary permissions are granted and that filmmakers and stakeholders receive compensation for the film screenings, if applicable. </p>
          <p>We specialize in organizing screenings for non-profit and educational institutions and have worked closely with and sought advice from legal departments at major US institutions to ensure that our screenings do not violate any copyright laws. We ensure that the legal status of each film we screen is given in writing and additionally provide documentation of all payments to the rightsholders.</p>
          <p class="well">We strive to take the guess work out of the increasingly complicated and confusing task of arranging film screenings so you can focus on the films themselves!
